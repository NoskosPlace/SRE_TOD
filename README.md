GCP docs and youtube were huge helps in learning more about the script

Was looking into terraform, Packer, Ansible. Started to setup each of these. I ran into a firewall issue with one. started playing in the shell of another and felt it was the same as running the script here as running in the cmd using gcloud cli.
